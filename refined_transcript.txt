Hello everyone. I've released a new version of the Comfy UI Depth Estimation node.

This update integrates the new Depth Anything V3 models, specifically the Small and Base versions, for improved depth quality.

I've also verified that video processing works correctly with batch inputs, and improved the installation process to handle dependencies more reliably.

You can update the node now, via the Comfy UI Manager.
