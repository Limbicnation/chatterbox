It's time to unlock the third dimension in ComfyUI.
Standard depth maps are great for ControlNet, but they don't tell you how the photo was taken. No camera info means no real 3D.
Enter the v1.3.5 update. We've integrated the full power of Depth Anything V3.
Check the box, and you get access to the raw data. We expose the full Extrinsics and Intrinsics matrices directly in the JSON output.
It's the raw, mathematically precise data you need to integrate with your own 3D pipelines. Perfect for advanced developers.
Update now and start building worlds. Link in the description!
